# Packet Manipulation for Code Injection
Injecting code in the content of web packets using scapy and netfilterqueue. Basic packet manipulation techniques are explored in the following codes. We first remove encoding to make the response packets readable. This response is then manipulated using regex. 
## Getting Started
Download the repository, run the main program using:
> Python == 3.7.4
>
> Scapy == 2.4.3
>
> NetfilterQueue == 0.8.1
>
